AI Daily Task Assistant

An intelligent assistant that learns from your daily tasks, guides you step-by-step, and helps automate repetitive workflows.

Overview

The AI Daily Task Assistant observes and learns from how users interact with their desktop, identifying patterns and breaking down tasks into manageable steps. It provides actionable guidance and suggestions to improve productivity while ensuring a seamless, privacy-conscious experience.

Key Features
	•	Task Monitoring: Tracks user actions like file manipulation, web browsing, and software interactions.
	•	Task Breakdown: Analyzes workflows and breaks tasks into clear, actionable steps.
	•	Automation Suggestions: Identifies repetitive tasks and proposes efficient automated solutions.
	•	Step-by-Step Guidance: Offers real-time guidance to complete tasks more effectively.
	•	Personalized Recommendations: Learns user preferences to suggest optimized workflows.

Use Case Examples
	1.	Email Management:
	•	Detects frequent actions like organizing emails into folders.
	•	Suggests an automation workflow to sort emails based on subject, sender, or content.
	•	Guides the user through creating rules in their email client.
	2.	Report Generation:
	•	Observes tasks like exporting data from a database, formatting it in Excel, and emailing it.
	•	Breaks the process into steps, provides templates, or automates the process entirely.
	3.	Daily Planning:
	•	Learns your scheduling habits and suggests time blocks for common tasks.
	•	Integrates with your calendar to add reminders and deadlines based on observed priorities.

How It Works
	1.	Observation:
The assistant monitors desktop activities securely, recording task patterns and context.
	2.	Analysis:
Machine learning algorithms identify repetitive workflows and segment tasks into logical steps.
	3.	Guidance:
Offers intuitive, plain-language suggestions for streamlining or automating tasks.
	4.	Automation:
After user approval, creates scripts or workflows that save time and reduce manual effort.

Privacy and Security
	•	User Control: The assistant tracks only what users allow and provides full transparency.
	•	Data Privacy: All data is stored locally or encrypted for secure cloud storage.
	•	Customizable Settings: Users can exclude specific apps or activities from monitoring.

Technology Stack
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	PyAutoGUI - Simulating mouse and keyboard inputs
	•	Scikit-learn - Machine learning for pattern recognition
	•	OpenCV - Screen activity tracking
	•	PyGetWindow - Application window context management
	•	Keyboard - Keystroke logging and control
	•	NLTK or OpenAI API - Natural language processing for task guidance

Here’s a more detailed Development Roadmap with a checklist format for tracking progress:

Development Roadmap

Phase 1: Monitoring and Data Collection

Goals:
	•	Implement functionality to monitor user activities (screen, keyboard, mouse).
	•	Capture the context of tasks, including application usage and active files.

Tasks:
	•	Screen Activity Tracking:
	•	Capture active window titles.
	•	Record screen changes at configurable intervals.
	•	Implement a mechanism to detect application switches.
	•	Mouse Movement Tracking:
	•	Log mouse coordinates and movements.
	•	Detect clicks (left, right, and double).
	•	Identify and log drag-and-drop actions.
	•	Keystroke Logging:
	•	Record key presses securely.
	•	Filter sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
	•	Include application-specific context for key presses.
	•	Application Context Capture:
	•	Monitor active application usage (e.g., duration, interactions).
	•	Log open file names and paths.
	•	Capture browser activity (URLs, tabs).

Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

Goals:
	•	Use machine learning to identify repetitive workflows.
	•	Segment complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

Tasks:
	•	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Clean and structure raw tracking data.
	•	Label common task patterns for training.
	•	Handle anomalies or interruptions in workflows.
	•	Machine Learning Model:
	•	Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., clustering, sequential models).
	•	Train models to identify repetitive patterns.
	•	Validate accuracy and refine based on user feedback.
	•	Task Segmentation:
	•	Define heuristics for segmenting tasks into steps.
	•	Link related actions across time spans (e.g., drag files and open a specific app).
	•	Implement testing to ensure accurate segmentation.

Phase 3: Task Guidance and Automation

Goals:
	•	Create a natural language interface to guide users through task completion.
	•	Develop approval workflows for automating repetitive tasks.

Tasks:
	•	Natural Language Interface:
	•	Integrate NLP for user queries (e.g., “What task can I automate?”).
	•	Implement plain-language breakdowns for detected workflows.
	•	Provide step-by-step guidance based on learned patterns.
	•	Automation Approval Workflow:
	•	Design an intuitive approval interface for suggested automations.
	•	Log user decisions to refine future suggestions.
	•	Build a “preview mode” for showing proposed automations before execution.
	•	Task Execution Module:
	•	Implement script generation for repetitive tasks.
	•	Create an automation engine to execute workflows.
	•	Add error handling and rollback features.

Phase 4: Advanced Features

Goals:
	•	Expand functionality to support multiple platforms.
	•	Enable cloud synchronization and tool integrations.

Tasks:
	•	Multi-Platform Support:
	•	Ensure compatibility with Windows.
	•	Develop macOS support (e.g., using PyObjC for system access).
	•	Add Linux compatibility with platform-specific implementations.
	•	Cloud Synchronization:
	•	Encrypt and securely store task patterns.
	•	Enable cross-device synchronization of learned workflows.
	•	Provide offline functionality with auto-sync when online.
	•	Tool Integrations:
	•	Connect with Slack for task updates and reminders.
	•	Integrate with Trello for task board management.
	•	Sync with Outlook or Google Calendar for scheduling tasks.
